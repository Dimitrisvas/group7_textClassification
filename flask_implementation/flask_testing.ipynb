    "# Task 4: Endpoint Testing\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to plan the testing required for this task, we decided to design tests around the basic features of the endpoint. The reasoning behind each test case as well as the aspect of the feature it tests will be explained as tests are introduced. It should be noted that for the purposes of this project, it was identified that testing specific UI elements such as buttons and links would not be required."

    "As testing UI elements is not required, each test will generally be performed by generating and sending HTTP requests to the endpoint, receiving and reading the endpoint's response, and validating its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be shown below that the process of performing each test is quite simple, with no logically or programmatically intensive solutions required to perform each test. For this reason, it was deemed that the more sophisticated, but more intensive testing solution provided within the **flask** library would not be used here. We will instead be using Python's own **requests** library, which is simpler to set up and install and easier to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "This does require, however, that an instance of the endpoint is already hosted locally, which is a drawback of opting to use the **requests** library."
